You configure:

* whether the entries in the cloud are ordered by name or post count
* whether the entries are sorted in an ascending, descending or random order
* whether the cloud is rendered as a flat list separated by spaces, as a UL tag with the wp-tag-cloud class, price tags or as a 3D HTML5 based tag cloud.
* the zoom factor in case of a 3D HTML5 based tag cloud
* the size of the smallest and largest items in the cloud (in percentage)

You can also choose to only consider posts with specific categories or tags.
