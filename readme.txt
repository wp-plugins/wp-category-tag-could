Display a configurable 2D or 3D cloud of tags, categories or any other taxonomy filtered by tags or categories.

== Description ==

WP Category Tag Cloud provides a configurable widget displaying a cloud of tags, categories or any other taxonomy.

The cloud elements can be displayed in different ways (see screenshots):

* as a flat list separated by spaces
* as a UL tag with the wp-tag-cloud class
* as price tags
* as rectangular tags with rounded corners
* as horizontal bars
* as a 3D HTML5 based tag cloud

Unlike other tag cloud plugins, WP Category Tag Cloud uses no Flash, but only HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display the cloud. This makes sure this plugin is compatible with any device with a modern browser.
It also doesn't generate the HTML tags for the cloud by itself but relies on WordPress functions. This means that if you use other plugins which add filters related to tag cloud, this plugin will integrate properly with them.

You can configure:

* the maximum number of taxonomy terms displayed
* whether the entries in the cloud are ordered by name or post count
* whether the entries are sorted in an ascending, descending or random order
* how the cloud should be rendered
* the zoom factor in case of a 3D HTML5 based tag cloud
* the size of the smallest and largest items in the cloud (in percentage)
* the font color used
* the background color used for horizontal bars
* the border color used for horizontal bars
* whether the opacity of the tags should be modified based on the usage
* whether to make links no-follow
* whether to tilt the displayed terms randomly
* whether to colorize the displayed terms randomly
* whether the widget should be cached and for how long

You can also choose to only consider posts with specific categories (with or without children) or tags.

If you do not want to display the cloud as a side bar widget but in the content of a page or post, you can use the short code (see the frequently asked questions). You can also use a PHP function to have the cloud displayed. More details also in the frequently asked section.

**Note that in version 1.3, the logic to filter displayed terms was changed:**

* up to version 1.2: If categories were displayed and you selected category A and B but there was a post with category B and C, category C was also displayed.
* from version 1.3: If categories are displayed and you select category A and B but there was a post with category B and C, category C will NOT be displayed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `wp-category-tag-could` to the `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Select the widget and configure it or use the PHP function or the short code

= How can I display a term cloud in a page or a post? =

You can use the showtagcloud short code.

Syntax: [showtagcloud options...]

Options:

* taxonomy: the taxonomy to be displayed e.g. post_tag, category...
* exclude: comma separated list of term IDs not to be displayed
* number: max number of terms to be displayed
* order_by: field by which to sort the terms in the tag. Should be "name" or "count"
* order: how to sort. Should be ASC, DESC or RAND (resp. ascending, descending or random)
* format: rendering type. "flat" for "Separated by whitespace", <option selected="selected" value="price" for "Price tags", "bars" for "Bars", "rounded" for "Rounded corners", "list" for "UL with a class of wp-tag-cloud", "array" for "3D HTML5 Cloud"
* tag_id: a comma separated list of tag IDs
* category_id: a comma separated list of category IDs
* child_categories: set to 1 to also consider child categories
* opacity: set to 1 so that the opacity of the different terms is modified based on the number of matching posts
* tilt: set to 1 to randomly tilt the terms
* colorize: set to 1 to randomly change the font color of the terms
* nofollow: set to 1 to make all link nofollow
* cache: set to 1 to cache the rendering of the cloud
* timeout: the cache timeout in seconds
* width: width of the 3D canvas. 0 means no specific width set. Use this to define the size of the generated canvas (to prevent pixelization due to stretching)
* height: height of the 3D canvas. 0 means no specific height set. Use this to define the size of the generated canvas (to prevent pixelization due to stretching)
* zoom: initial zoom factor e.g. 1
* smallest: smallest font size in percent of the default font size e.g. 75
* largest: largest font size in percent of the default font size e.g. 200
* color: font color e.g \#ffffff
* background: background color e.g. \#333333
* border: border color e.g. \#AAAAAA

= How can I programmatically insert a term cloud ? =

Use the show_tag_cloud() function. It takes an associative array as parameter. The parameters are the same as for the short code above.

The easiest way to get to the code you need to write is to first create a new post or page (you won't need to publish it) and add a shortcode using the additional button provided in the visual editor. Select all the settings you want to have an insert the shortcode to the post/page. You can also use the preview button to see how the cloud would look like.

Let's assume this is the shortcode which was generated:

        [showtagcloud taxomony="category", format="array", number="20", color="#FF5800", background="FFFFFF"]

Since the arguments of the shortcode are the same arguments as the ones of the show_tag_cloud() function, you can then copy them. So in the example above copy the following: taxomony="category", format="array", number="20", color="#FF5800", background="FFFFFF"

Then go to the theme editor and open the file you want to add it in, as an example we'll add it to the category archive of my theme. The code looked like this before my change:

    get_header(); ?>
        <section id="primary" class="content-area">
            <div id="content" class="site-content" role="main">

                <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

                <header class="archive-header">
                    <h1 class="archive-title"><?php printf( __( 'Category Archives: %s', 'twentyfourteen' ), single_cat_title( '', false ) ); ?></h1>

We'll add a call to show_tag_cloud, paste the copied arguments and change the list of arguments to an associative array. Here the resulting code:

    get_header(); ?>
        <section id="primary" class="content-area">
            <div id="content" class="site-content" role="main">
                <?php show_tag_cloud(array( taxomony=>"category", format=>"array", number=>"20", color=>"#FF5800", background=>"FFFFFF" ));?>

                <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

                <header class="archive-header">
                    <h1 class="archive-title"><?php printf( __( 'Category Archives: %s', 'twentyfourteen' ), single_cat_title( '', false ) ); ?></h1>

Of course if you want to style it differently (e.g. center it and specify a width and height), you can wrap it with a div element with the appropriate style e.g. :

    get_header(); ?>
        <section id="primary" class="content-area">
            <div id="content" class="site-content" role="main">
                <div style="width:600px;height:320px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
                    <?php show_tag_cloud(array( taxomony=>"category", format=>"array", number=>"20", color=>"#FF5800", background=>"FFFFFF" ));?>
                </div>

                <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

                <header class="archive-header">
                    <h1 class="archive-title"><?php printf( __( 'Category Archives: %s', 'twentyfourteen' ), single_cat_title( '', false ) ); ?></h1>
